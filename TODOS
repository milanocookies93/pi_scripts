It would probably be nice to have an update script that helps people manage thier RPis.

Maybe a site would be nice for all this.

Probably a post request to a site.

May want to have a more friendly install / deploy script. Basically a default one for newcommers.

Would also be nice to have a set up for wifi.

Need to shift this to issues.

Need to split this repo for the new lock system.
